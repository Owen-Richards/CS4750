# Database Project

## What is the project

Created a movie database where users can add movies to a watch list, already seen list and a favourite movie list. Users 
are able to use a movie search feature where the web page finds the movie through users choice of director, title, ranking or year 
the film was released. Additionally, users are able to make public reviews about different movies and provide their own personal score 
about each movie.

The project used a mySQL relational database hosted on the University of Virginia CS server. The technologies used in the project 
were SQL, PHP, JavaScript, CSS along with database concepts to organize the backend.
